**Q: What features does Habitu Pro unlock?** A: Purchasing Habitu Pro is a one-time payment that permanently unlocks the ability to create unlimited habits in the app.

**Q: I bought Pro, but the feature is still locked. What should I do?** A: First, please make sure you are logged in with the same Apple ID you used to make the purchase. Then, go to the "Habitu Pro" screen inside the app and tap the "Restore Purchase" button. This will sync your purchase with the App Store and unlock the pro features.

**Q: How do I restore my purchase on a new device?** A: The process is the same. After installing Habitu on your new device, go to the "Habitu Pro" screen and tap "Restore Purchase". This will restore your lifetime Pro access at no additional cost.
